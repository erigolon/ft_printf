## Description

The **ft_printf** project is a fundamental project at 42school that requires students to recreate the `printf` function found in the standard C library.

The `printf` function is a powerful tool for printing formatted output to the console, and the **ft_printf** project challenges students to implement their own version of this function using the concepts they have learned in previous projects.

The **ft_printf** function accepts a format string and a variable number of arguments, and then formats and prints the output to the console according to the specified format. The format string can include various format specifiers, such as `%s` for strings, `%d` for integers, `%f` for floating-point numbers, and many others.

## Usage

``make`` to compile all the functions.
